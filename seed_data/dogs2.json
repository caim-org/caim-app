I love people and so loyal that I patiently wait for my people to come home but luckily they don\u2019t take that long! \nI love indoors being indoors and  to cozy up inside. I\u2019m calm and definitely not a barker! When you take me out on a walk get ready for some major attention my way! I am an American Staffy mix and when you read about me pretty much on point.

He does the same thing to let you know when he\u2019s hungry or thirsty and once he\u2019s gotten what he\u2019s asking for he goes right back to bed,\n\nHe absolutely loves being held and being with another human or even another dog, if you let him sleep with you he buries himself right into you.\n\nCookie would do amazing in any home where he receives daily attention and has at least one person who\u2019s attentive to his needs. Because of his conditions he needs a little more direct care than some other dogs but it\u2019s an extremely rewarding feeling to bond with a dog who absolutely loves and needs you.\n\nHe receives insulin twice daily within 30 minutes of breakfast and dinner and also gets eye drops as necessary. If you are interested in Cookie, please complete the on-line application that can be found on our website: \n\nwww.adoptmerescue.org or contact us for more information.\n\nYou may email:\n adoptmerescue@gmail.com\n arabinowitz3@hotmail.com\n or call 818-732-0733 if any questions. \n",

Sam is extremely easy to walk on a leash, is non-reactive to other dogs while walking (although he does like to chase a bird or squirrel...but hey, he is a dog.) Per Sam's previous home, he prefers to be the only pet in the household, and would also like to be in adult only home.

Luckily, the rescuers rescued him and was later put into a sanctuary. In this sanctuary, GuaiGuai sadly was bitten by a dog so harshly that he took a piece of his lower back and ear. GuaiGuai is not aggressive towards dogs but his past experience made it so that he needs to be able to trust them before he gets comfortable. GuaiGuai is extremely mellow and such a caring courageous loveable dog to be around.

The first step in the process is to fill out an adoption application on our website roversretreat.org *\n\nMeet Deren! This handsome fella is a 1 year old golden boy. He came from a puppy mill in Canada where he spent most of his life in a cage. He has spent the last couple of weeks settling in at his foster home and is now ready to find his forever family!\n\nDeren is initially timid but warms up quickly. He is very food and attention motivated. His foster has been working with him a lot to get him comfortable in new situations and he has made amazing progress! He is enjoying walks throughout the day and he just hangs out around the house the rest of the time.\n\nDeren has done very well with his potty training when he has access to the backyard. He sleeps all night in bed with his foster parents and is a super cuddly boy! He is a velcro dog who always wants to be near, and touching you. Deren is being fostered in a home with two teenagers and other dogs. Deren would love a home with kids but will initially take a little while for him to warm up to everyone.\n\nBecause Deren was not socialized for most of his life he is definitely lacking confidence. The other dogs in the home have helped a lot to teach him that things are okay, and to help him gain more confidence. Having another dog in the home will be very important for Deren\u2019s succ3ss. He loves to play with the other dogs but also has an easy going temperament where he will happily just lay around near the other dogs and people. \n\nDeren will do best with a confident, patient, and loving owner to show him how great life can be\u2026 If you\u2019re interested in adopting Deren please fill out an adoption application on our website roversretreat.org\n\n\nAny additional questions about Deren can be directed to Sydney@roversretreat.org\n\n*PLEASE NOTE: Deren is being fostered in Simi Valley and his adoption fee is $1,500*",

Murray has a happy voice and will bark\/yodel to play or to ask to go inside\/outside but is generally quiet. \n\nMurray is a smart boy and knows sit, stay, down and is quickly developing fetch skills. He is easy to walk with a gentle leader however he pulls quite a bit with a leash or harness. An experienced large dog handler to help him continue to work on leash skills would e preferred, however he learns quickly and displays a strong enthusiasm to please people. \n\nMurray sleeps happily as long as he can share the bed with someone, anyone will do we have found he just really likes to cuddle. Murray keeps a close eye on his people and wants to be nearby at all times. Murray would do best with a large yard to stretch his legs in and also a family that enjoys at least one good walk per day. Murray enjoys the company of another playful dog as well.  If you are looking for  a snuggle love bug who will be up for any activity please consider Murray.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about Murray, please fill out our adoption application at www.roversretreat.org.

            "description": "*If you\u2019re interested in adopting Cookie please fill out an adoption application on our website: www.roversretreat.org*\n\nThis adorable little girl is Cookie, a 1 year old petite golden girl. She is a fabulous dog\u2026loving and cuddly with her people, playful with her toys, and is very gentle. Cookie has moderate energy, and she is relaxed and quiet at home. She enjoys car rides, beach trips, and adventures as well. \n\nCookie loves playing fetch, and hanging around with her people. Cookie enjoys her walks and does pretty good on leash, but may react with a bark or low growl when she sees unfamiliar dogs. Cookie is a sensitive girl, and some new things are a bit intimidating to her. For example, she needs slow introductions to new dogs and young kids so she doesn\u2019t feel threatened by them. She has lived with a young (3 year old) child and did great with him, but she needs supervised and slow introductions to children. Her fosters have worked with her and she now has a doggie friend to do play dates with. \n\nCookie would do best with people who are home more often than not, as she can get a little anxious when left alone. However, she is ok being crated for those times. She has excellent house manners and has left her foster\u2019s belongings intact. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about Cookie, please fill out our adoption application at www.roversretreat.org. Questions can be directed to nancy@roversretreat.org\n\nNOTE: this dog belongs to Rover\u2019s Retreat. Angel\u2019s Bark Dog Rescue is helping find a great home for her. \n\nCookie\u2019s adoption fee is $800",

The first step in the process is to fill out an adoption application on our website roversretreat.org *\n\nMeet Evie! Evie is a gorgeous 5 month old golden girl. Her former owner had her living outdoors while they worked long hours and decided to give her up to find a better home. Evie has spent time settling in at her foster home and beginning to learn how to live in a house\u2026 She is doing so well, loving life, and is now ready for her forever home!\n\nEvie LOVES other dogs and absolutely needs another young dog in his forever home. Evie is obsessed with her golden foster sister and plays with her all throughout the day. She also takes corrections well from the senior dog in her foster home, but of course, has lots of puppy energy. She can be initially taken back by extreme puppy energy, but she warms up quick and once comfortable she will play all day!\n\nEvie is pure puppy and is working on some typical puppy habits. Potty training is a work in progress and something Evie\u2019s forever family will need to continue working with her on. She is very food motivated and is still learning where she is supposed to go potty after not having access to the house in her former home. She is making progress everyday so with continued work she will be great! Evie is still learning what is appropriate to chew on (ex. Hands and faces vs toys), but he is learning. Evie would do well in a home with kids, but she does need patient adults in the home to manage the interactions, teach the kids how to be around a puppy, and be aware that puppies jump, bite, and are crazy! Evie loves to play with everyone she meets so an active, social family would be perfect for her. \n\nEvie doesn\u2019t have all her vaccines yet, but once she does she will need plenty of daily activity! She is already proving to be a high energy girl and has big paws, so she is going to be large! A family looking for an active puppy to take places and train is her ideal\u2026 She loves the car and going everywhere with her foster family. Evie is an amazing, social, and goofy puppy who just loves being part of everyday life with her people and going fun places!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Evie please fill out an adoption application on our website roversretreat.org\n\n*PLEASE NOTE: Evie is being fostered in Redondo Beach and his adoption fee is $800*\n",

The first step in the process is to fill out an adoption application on our website roversretreat.org *\n\nMeet Simon, a precious 2 year old terrier mix! This cutie is an absolute sweetheart who has spent the last couple of weeks getting comfortable at his foster home and is now ready to find his forever family.\n\nSimon came into rescue when his owner was put into a nursing home and could not longer care for him. His foster family has had nothing but good things to say about him! He will cuddle all night in bed and is just a social butterfly. Simon is being fostered in a home with two large dogs and he\u2019s done amazing. He is a more submissive dog who has no issue rolling over when the other pups get to be a little too much, but he also has no issue keepign up running around the yard and wrestling! He has tons of energy and loves to play and be active but he also equally loves to hang out on the couch and cuddle for hours. \n\nSimon would be amazing in a family with kids as long as the parents understand that dogs jump and should always be supervised around dogs. Simon loves to play fetch, go for walks, and just be with his people. Simon would do best in a home with another dog and a yard for potty breaks and playtime! \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting Simon please fill out an adoption application on our website roversretreat.org\n\n*PLEASE NOTE: Simon is being fostered in Redondo Beach and his adoption fee is $500*\n",

After finding out his previous owner didn\u2019t want him back, she asked if we could help\u2026which of course we did! We don\u2019t know how old he really is, but we\u2019re guessing somewhere between 12-13 is about right. Boday\u2019s a very sweet, calm boy who loves his walks. He\u2019s easy going and likes to chill out most of the day, and would love a home with a yard so he has easy access outdoors. He does have some back pain, so a home where he doesn\u2019t have to go up and down a lot of stairs would be beneficial. He loves to snuggle up & nap or watch TV with you all day. If you\u2019re looking for a sweet senior pup to be your buddy, Boday might be your boy! \n\nBoday belongs to Rover\u2019s Retreat. Angel\u2019s Bark is helping share his information to find his forever home. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about him, email nancy@roversretreat.org and fill out our adoption application at www.roversretreat.org. Boday\u2019s adoption fee is $300",

            "description": "*PLEASE NOTE: The first step in the process is to fill out an adoption application on our website roversretreat.org *\n\nMeet Ember! This gorgeous girl is an 8 month old F1 labradoodle. She DOES shed, and is as sweet as can be. Ember came into rescue when her owner realized they couldn\u2019t give her the attention and care she deserved. She has spent the last few weeks settling in at her foster home and is now ready for her forever family!\n\nEmber is a goofy puppy who is constantly keeping her foster family entertained and laughing! She will play with herself, throwing toys up in the air, and loves to play fetch and tug with her people. Ember loves her long walks and is an active girl. She has not walked in her previous home so she is still learning how to be on leash. She walks better with the use of a gentle leader head collar or a front clip harness, which helps to teach her not to pull. She is reactive when she sees other dogs on walks, will pull towards and cry wanting to meet everyone! She is a social butterfly and wants to be everyone\u2019s best friend, so the leash reactivity is something her forever family will need to work with her on. She is food motivated and very smart so with time and training she will get so much better.\n\nEmber has done very well with her potty training when she has access to the backyard. She sleeps all night in bed with her foster parents and loves it! She is a velcro dog who wants to cuddle and be near you all the time. Ember is being fostered in a home with two kids ages 13 and 9 and she adores them! She would love a home with kids, but is a big, crazy puppy so if placed with kids she will need patient parents. She jumps up for love and can be mouthy sometimes, but is easily redirected to toys. She wants attention from everyone and would do best with a very social family who will take her to lots of places. \n\nWhile Ember is being fostered without other dogs right now she has done well at the dog park, and when she\u2019s spent time at homes with other dogs. She will want to play but does have puppy brain, so another playful dog to keep her busy but who will also set boundaries will be perfect for this sweet pup.\n\nEmber is a happy, go-lucky pup who will thrive in a patient, active family\u2026 If you\u2019re interested in adopting Ember please fill out an adoption application on our website roversretreat.org\n\n\nAny additional questions about Ember can be directed to Sydney@roversretreat.org\n\n*PLEASE NOTE: Ember is being fostered in Pasadena and her adoption fee is $600 *\n",

I am an 11 year old husky\/Shepard mix. \n\nI have sad tale with a possible happy-ending! \n\nOn 6\/29\/22, I was found in La Mirada, CA by a nice lady who tried three times to capture me. I was scared of her and every other human who was trying to capture me because I had been on my own running the street for more than three days. She turned out to be a very nice lady. \n\nShe took me to the doctors because my paws were hurting me. Turns out I just wore my paw pads out after all the days alone on the hot pavement. I think cost her a lot of money because she kept telling me I was \u201clucky I was as cute\u201d over and over again. ?\n\nThe nice lady found my owner of 11 years. It\u2019s the only home I have ever known. It breaks my heart to say but my owner doesn\u2019t want me back ?. Apparently, my owner can not take care me anymore and can\u2019t keep me from getting out. I feel sad, but those fireworks just scared me so bad. \n\nThankfully, the nice lady is letting me stay with her temporarily instead of being in a loud and scary shelter. Old guys like me don\u2019t last long at the shelter.\n\nI am happy not be in the shelter but NOW I want to find my forever home - is that with you and your family? Please help keep me out of the shelter. \n\nI am a good boy. I promise. I just need lots love and attention. I am very nervous and anxious when you first meet me but with TIME and PATIENCE I will warm up to you and then become your shadow. I don\u2019t like to be left alone right now but the nice lady is working on that with me. \n\nI am extremely smart - I should have been named Einstein or Houdini! I guess that\u2019s the Husky in me. \nI love pets and cuddles after I settle in with you. I just learned how to play and I love it! \nI get along great with other dogs big or small (see the video of me with my temp foster brother). I not sure how I feel about cats yet. \nHowever, sudden movements make me nervous. \nI am fully vaccinated as of 7\/17\/22. \nI am neutered. \nMy doggie doctor said I have no major health issues or abnormalities. \n\nContact the lady who is caring for me if you want to meet me?! Her name is Stephanie Rigoli. 562-477-0061.\u201d\n",

Liam is approx 2 years old and weighs about 65 pounds. He is a distemper survivor which means while living on the streets he survived the deadly distemper disease. He has a slight bob of his head from this but it doesn't affect his day to day living. Liam is a strong boy who will need an owner who will be able to control him on walks as he is strong and can be reactive to people and other dogs while walking. His foster is also working with him on his barking and he is significantly improving daily!\n\nLiam is house trained and has not had an accident in his foster home and sleeps through the night without any issues. He is enjoys his walks and is currently getting 3+ miles a day! He would make a great companion for someone who loves to hike and go on adventures! \n\nLiam loves people and enjoys being as close to his foster family as he can. He is still learning how to socialize with other dogs and will need a family who will be willing to slowly socialize him. Liam would do well in a home with another calm dog who will respect his space and let him warm up. \n\nThere is no doubt that Liam will make an excellent companion for the right person or family! If you are active, have the patience to give Liam the time and training he needs Liam could be the one for you! \n\nIf you are interested in Liam, please head over to our website www.roversretreat.org to fill out an adoption application. \n\nPlease note: Liam is being fostered in Van Nuys, CA and his adoption fee is $400.",

            "description": "Snow is a 2-3 -year old German Shepherd\/Golden Retriever-mix female. When you meet her  you would think she is a Golden Retriever, as she looks like a Golden, but she behaves more like a protective German Shepherd. She weighs about 75-80 pounds and has a beautiful fluffy coat. Once she settles in, she is very devoted to her people and loyal. She is a medium-energy dog that enjoys being with her people, follows them everywhere and loves to lie right next to her person - she is pretty much a velcro dog. You can tell that she loves going for walks, because  she puts on quite a display of happiness and excitement by the door. On her walks she can be difficult and reactive, like a German Shepherd, so her future owner needs to be strong and healthy (someone with back and shoulder issues can't handle Snow) to be able to walk her; she will also need obedience training, so the owner could learn how to handle her during their daily walks.\n\nInside the house Snow is almost perfect and very well-behaved. She is not destructive when left alone, does not try to escape the yard, is not a fence jumper and not a digger. She loves toys and her favorite game is chasing balls. When she is happy she loves running in circles in the yard - and she can run pretty fast! She knows the \u201cSit\u201d, \u201cDown\u201d and \u201cPaw\u201d commands and loves getting belly rubs and giving her paw. This gorgeous girl is very affectionate and likes giving kisses.\nShe is wonderful with other dogs after a slow introduction. In her foster home she has been living with small- and large-size dogs and does well with them all - at first she doesn\u2019t play much, but once she settles in and feels that she is a part of the family, she starts playing with other dogs. Snow has the instincts of a German Shepherd and will protect her person and her house. In her foster home she is allowed to sleep anywhere she wants, but she prefers to sleep right by the door all night and will warn you if needed.\n\nDue to her being a protective dog, she will bark and might lunge\/snap at visiting dogs and people. The solution her foster mom has found is to put Snow in a crate from where she can see the people and can sniff the visiting dogs; she will probably bark for 5-10 minutes, but once she knows the visitors are harmless she chills out and lays down. When Snow is done barking and chilling for 10-15min, her foster mom opens the crate door, so Snow could smell the visitors; once that\u2019s done, Snow is usually good to go. She is generally quiet, but being an alert dog she will bark when hearing noises. Snow is very housebroken, knows how to use a doggie door and is crate-trained. She loves going for car rides and has no problem jumping into the back of a SUV, but during the ride she will bark at things that arrest her attention.\nEven though she is good with all-size dogs in her foster home, Snow is not a dog to take to dog parks.\nWhat type of home does Snow need?\n* An adult home with no kids, with another dog OR as an only-dog. She is more into people than dogs, but will enjoy having a friend too.\n* The adopter needs to commit to doing obedience work and leash-training in order to adopt her\nIf you are willing to work with her and be patient, Snow is a wonderful, sweet dog.\nWe are located in Los Angeles. If interested in Snow please submit an application on our website, www.angelsbarkrescue.org\n",

            "description": "Tessa is a sweet, female German Shepherd about 6-8 years old, about 80 pounds . This adorable girl spent 7 months in a shelter. We rescued her on  the day she was to be euthanized.\nTessa is a confident, well-balanced soul, and loves people. She gets attached quickly, and follows her person everywhere. She's a \u201cvelcro\u201d dog, but also enjoys her space and easily settles into \"downtime.\"\nTessa is totally housebroken, and has no problem being alone if her person leaves. She is not destructive and rarely barks. She is good alone in a secure yard, and won't try to escape by digging or trying to jump a fence.\nTessa LOVES going for daily walks and does well on leash. She doesn\u2019t pull much after a few minutes of intense sniffing, and with some basic training she will be a perfect dog. She will definitely enjoy an active owner, but also has no problem being mellow and napping on her bed.\nShe is always happy to see people (more than other pets). Tessa enjoys car rides: she'll look out the window, or lies down and remain calm.\nShe loves to be brushed and did great at the groomer. She also did great at her vet exam, and gave kisses to the doctor. \nTessa loves bones and toys. She likes playing fetch: she brings the ball back, and drops it. \n\nHer Previous Foster Mom wrote:\n\"Tessa is always happy - loves to follow you around, and has been great with older kids (10 yr. olds). She knows \u201cSit\u201d and  \u201cStop\u201d and is practicing \u201cStay.\" She is not protective of toys, bones or her food bowl. She sits for the leash to be put on. She likes to fetch but after a few throws she likes to lie down with the ball. She\u2019s a sure-footed explorer and it\u2019s entertaining to watch her squeeze through small spaces - she doesn\u2019t realize how big she is! She\u2019s never tried to jump a wall, or escape. Her nose investigates EVERYTHING. She\u2019s good around people's food \u2013 she doesn\u2019t beg. By 8pm she\u2019s down for the count and sleeps through the night. She will go in her crate during the day for a couple of hours, if needed. Tessa reacts towards unfamiliar dogs during walks and seems to show a prey drive towards small animals - a home with no cats is recommended. She\u2019d benefit from an experienced owner who will work on consistent obedience. Tessa\u2019s ideal home would have to have a secure yard, and grass to roll around in.\nTessa is a wonderful dog! Someone will surely be blessed to have her in their life. She is located in Los Angeles.-- \n\n\n\n",

            "description": " *PLEASE NOTE: This doggie belongs to another rescue called Rovers Retreat Rescue Organization. We are just posted as courtesy post to help. If you have any questions please email them directly by emailing them at roversretreat.org@gmail.com \n\n*PLEASE NOTE: Ozzie does shed. The first step in the adoption process is to fill out an adoption application on our website: roversretreat.org *\n\nMeet Ozzie. Ozzie is an adorable 1-year-old possible West Highland Terrier \/ poodle mix who is as sweet as can be! While he looks like he could be a labradoodle, please note that he DOES shed. \nOzzie came into rescue when his owners had to move into an apartment that did not allow big dogs. He has spent the past few weeks settling in at his foster home and is now ready to find his forever family.\n\nOzzie is a very happy boy who loves his people. He sleeps all night in his foster mom\u2019s bed and is quite the cuddle buddy. He is definitely a velcro dog and will follow his foster mom around the house seeking attention throughout the day. He is a great work-from-home buddy and will just sleep at his fosters\u2019 feet while she works during the day, or will pick up a toy and entertain himself. \n\nOzzie is getting a few daily walks and greatly enjoys his time out in the neighborhood. He is still getting used to walking on leash, but he\u2019s getting better every day. He gets anywhere from 2-5 miles of walking a day and is the best fit for an active person ready to give him plenty of daily activity and adventure! He would be a perfect hiking buddy, as well. \n\nOzzie has been a pretty good houseguest in his foster home, although he is a young dog still so he still needs to be watched closely at times. He has done very well with potty training and will go out into the yard when he needs to go potty. Ozzie does have his mischievous times. After all, he is a puppy! He will find things to chew on if left unattended and he doesn\u2019t get the exercise he needs. It is important that Ozzie\u2019s forever family give him plenty of exercise, puppy proof, as well as to not leave him alone with full reign of the house at first. He is a very smart boy, so as long as he is set up for success he will learn very quickly what you want from him. \n\nOzzie has been working on his interactions with other dogs since he is being fostered in a home without other animals, and he is getting better! He can be reactive on leash when walking sometimes but this has been less and less frequent as he has settled in more. With a new change he will likey be reactive when seeing other dogs, but with gentle corrections and time this will get better as it did when he settled in at his foster home. Ozzie would do best in a home without any other animals with owners dedicated to training and continting to work with him on his social skills. \n\nOzzie is eager to find his forever family with people who love walks, play, and cuddles as much as he does. If you are interested in adopting Ozzie please fill out an adoption application on our website: Roversretreat.org\n\nAny questions can be directed to Sydney@roversretreat.org\n\n*PLEASE NOTE: Ozzie\u2019s adoption fee is $500 and he is being fostered in Northridge*\n",

She absolutely loves people, always has a big smile on her face and is very affectionate. She is one of those dogs that just loves to be at her person's side.\n\nNikki is housebroken, crate-trained  and not destructive. Even though she does well with  large size dogs, she needs a home with no other dogs.\n\nNikki is excellent on leash, walking right by her person and behaves very mannerly around the public. She is a trained dog - she knows \u201cHeel\u201d, \u201cSit\u201d, \u201cStay\u201d, \u201cCome\u201d and \u201cDown\u201d. She has done an agility course and loves it.\n\nNikki was owned by an elderly man who had saved her from one of the high-kill shelters. Sadly, her owner had a terminal illness and died a couple of years ago. Nikki has been looking for a forever home since then.\n\nWhat type of home does Nikki need?\n- A household with or without kids, as she loves everyone.\n- Someone who is home a lot.\n- A home where she can be an only-dog or with another dog as a companion.\n\nNikki is very agile and can jump low fences, so a fence of min. 6-ft in height is required.",

I was born in Mexico and was transported up to Los Angeles as a puppy \u2014 and now I am looking for a forever home to call my own. I am abut 2 years old. My trainer would describe me as a very sweet and sometimes shy boy who loves to play and have fun, once I feel comfortable. It does take me a little bit of time to warm up to new people in my life, but if I am afraid I will let you know so that you can help me through it. I would do best in a calm home with no small children, hopefully with a patient parent who can help me continue to learn to be the best boy that I know I can be. I love to play with other dogs and would do great in a house as the only dog or with a sibling dog that can help to show me the ropes. I am very respectful with other dogs and know how to give space when they ask for it, so I would ask for the same in return! Sometimes loud noises and the city environment can scare me, but I have been working very hard with my trainer and I doing so much better! I can be scared of any new encounters, but once I get to know you I love to cuddle and will follow you around everywhere that you go. Crate training and having the proper amount of daily exercise are both really working out great for me, and I can\u2019t wait to find my forever home. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about Decker please submit an adoption application on our website www.loveatfirstmutt.org ",

Taquito is the sweetest little guy \u2013 very quiet, he never barks even when he\u2019s startled by some noise or approached by strangers. He spends most of his time resting calmly in his bed or on the sofa, whatever feels more comfortable. \n\nHe gets along really well with all types of dogs, even the most excited ones. He also likes to follow humans with treats, sitting around them and patiently waiting for his turn to get one. As an older dog, he enjoys a routine very much but gets super enthusiastic around walk and meal times. These are the moments of the days where you\u2019ll see him joyfully jump around and run after you. He has lots of stamina, is able to go on hikes with his foster parents and climb up and down steep hills when needed, but he also likes taking his time to smell flowers and bushes. \n\nHe\u2019s the easiest dog to walk on a leash, and he is potty trained \u2013 he currently goes out twice a day. If you\u2019d like to meet Taquito please submit an adoption application on our website www.loveatfirstmutt.org",

Willy originally came from a hoarding case in the high desert and has taken a little while to be socialized. He is very dog friendly & gets along well with all animals including cats. He\u2019s potty trained now & working on leash training. Willy can be a little shy at first but once he trusts you, he\u2019s very affectionate & loving. He enjoys playing with his toys & chewing on bones. Willy is also learning how to fetch & bring back the toy. He\u2019s a very gentle soul & would do best in a calm home with patient humans.",

            "description": "*Special Needs* - Deacon is 3 years old - Cattle dog mix - extremely intelligent and sturdy with a strong sense of adventure and an invincible mindset. He\u2019s 45 lbs, neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped. Deacon was hit by a car in Jan of 2020 & suffered 2 broken legs. He was taken to the shelter where he was going to be PTS. ERF rescue decided to give him a second chance. He underwent 3 complicated surgeries. He walks well on his legs now but will need to kept from jumping on furniture or using a lot of stairs. \n\nHe gets many gentle daily walks. He is happy to chill in a crate or at your side. He is young and has learned many commands, this guy will flourish with an EXPERIENCED cattle dog owner who can give him structure. He has mostly been on a leash for now-as he\u2019s very energetic & could Re-injure himself but can be taken off leash for playtime in a secure area. As he matures and becomes stronger, the vet feels he can spend more time off leash . Deacon is dog friendly if properly introduced & monitored. He has been around cats & has been ok with them. We would NOT suggest he be around small animals such as rabbits, chickens, etc. as he has a high prey drive.",

Approx. 7 years old, and 30 pounds. We think she's a Dachshund\/Lab mix. A gorgeous girl with a shining black coat.\n\nShe gets along with other dogs, and is potty trained. No cats for this girl. Skylar needs a home with a yard. Not suited for apartment living.\n\nSkylar's a very sweet and loving girl, but needs more socialization. She will make some lucky person or family very happy.\n\nIf you're interested in adopting Skylar, please complete an adoption application at our website: www.dachshundrescueoflosangeles.com to be pre-approved.",

He loves to play with his foster brother, with his squeaky toys and go for walks. He likes spending time with me, but Tbone (his foster Dachshund brother) is a close second.\n\nPros:\n\nHouse broken\n\nKnew instantly how to use a doggie door and uses it to go outside and hang out\n\nVery good walking on a leash\n\nDoes not get on furniture\n\nsleeps in his crate\n\nSweet and adorable!\n\nCons:\n\nis fine if I leave and Tbone is home, but if I am walking Tbone, Brimsley will sit by the door and cry.,\n\nNot much of a barker, but if he hears it on TV and\/or sees the dog next door he will bark.\n\nWatch when you walk, he is always very close!\n\nHe does not like larger dogs.\n\nBrimsley needs a home with a yard that he can explore.\n\nNeeds a calm, quiet environment. Right now he is with his female foster, and one other Dachshund. Brimsley just wants a stress free place to enjoy his senior years.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Brimsley, please fill out an adoption application at our website: www.dachshundrescueoflosangeles.com\n\nYou will need to travel to Las Vegas to pick him up if approved.",

Not totally blind, but she has limited vision. Requires Insulin every 12 hours.\n\nLoves playing with toys, and her other fur siblings. Potty trained, and loves being next to you. Knows how to use the ramp and steps to get on the sofa.\n\nNO apartments or condos as she is quite a barker. Home with yard only, please.\n\nIf selected as her adopter, you would have to drive to Las Vegas to pick her up.
