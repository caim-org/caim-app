            "description": "Can we play?\nI am a happy boyand I love to play with my friends, whether they are human or dogs!I sometimes am a little nervousmeeting new people, and I am also nervouswhen new people come to the door. I will get more training to help me with this! When I am home, I love getting pet and will snuggle up close to get belly rubs. Smelling things is my favorite hobby, whether it be around the house or on walks. I love to be outside exploring the sights and the sounds of the yard. I get very excited when I see other dogs while on walks and I want to go up to them and say hello. If I get too overwhelmed, however, I can be pretty noisy. I'm an adventurer at heart, so if I am left alone outside too long, I may get bored and decide to go explore the neighborhood, despite the fence.I'd dobest in a home withchildren 13 years and older. Another dog is a must!\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I'm a sweet boy and a little shy meeting new people. I do warm up quickly. I like my crate, especially if there is food inside. I love to play with other dogs. I am a smart boy and will love to continue training.\n\nDoes Sheriff like other pets?\n\nI absolutely love to play with other dogs, it's one of my favorite things! We can get loud and rambunctious but it's all in good fun. I gotreally excited when I saw a cat on one of my walks and would need to figure out how I feel about them before committing to living with one.\n\nDoes Sheriff like children?\n\nI haven't met any children while I've been with my fosters, but I like to jump, chase, and gently nip when I'm excited, so I'd probably do best around children over 13.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\nI like Kongs stuffed with my favorite foods, and NylaBones. Tennis balls are also fun to chase but I'd prefer to be playing with another dog or human instead of an inanimate object!\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\nMy ideal foreverhome would have another dog who likes to play, and a yard with at least a six foot fence! I am learning how to work for treats, and I would like to continue my undergrad in good boy-ism! A home without cats or small children would be ideal, along with a family who has a lot of love (and belly rubs) to give!",

            "description": "I can't wait to meet my new best friend!\nI'm a sensitive, gentle soul who has been through difficult times. It takes me a long while to trust. But once I feel comfortable, I am an easygoing, playful, goofy guy! My favorite thing to do is cuddle on the couch or in bed with you and sprawl out on my back. In the morning I am so excited for the day, I might even give you kisses! I'd do fine with other dogs and may do best in a home with older children, 13 years old and older.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n Although I like to share space with people, I'm not used to this 'petting' thing. It can be startling when someone reaches out toward me. I also have had really scary experiences with the leash, and will need a lot of time to work on this. I walk very nicely and enjoy myself once I'm on the leash, though! I will need time to warm up to new people.\n\nDoes Jasper like other pets?\n\nI love other dogs and communicate with them very well. If they are too pushy with me, it makes me afraid, so I would love another nice friendly dog to play with. I'm very respectful of cats.\n\nDoes Jasper like children?\n\n I haven't had a chance to meet children yet at my foster home. Due to my shy nature, I may do best with older children.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\nI don't know how to play with toys yet. But I love a good Kong with peanut butter or plain yogurt - I will do anything for yogurt!\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n I will need an experienced best friend to bond with who is patient, quiet and kind. I will need to continue having positive experiences with new people and places throughout my life to stay happy and socialized. I'd do great in a home with another, social dog and in a home with older children or no children.",

I want to be around my person and alwaystouching them when we are together. I love to play tug, chew bones, and get exercise. If I can cuddle while doing so, even better! Most importantly, I LOVE CARS! I always want to hop in the car or truck.I am afraid of new experiences, but I am brave. As long as I can smell around, I will warm up to the new person, place, or thing. Although I am deaf, I constantly check in and read the social cues given by people and other animals, aswell. I'd do best in a home with children 13 years and older. Please no apartments for me, I can bark a bit and we thinkI may get in trouble in an apartment!\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I have lived with cats and older children. I do fine with some dogs, but will need a slow introduction and very specific boundaries in the house as I tend to guard resources. While outside on a leash, I have only shown positive interest in other dogs. When I am uncomfortable with another dog, I will warn them with a low growl.Typically, I warm up quickly after my warning. I have not had any accidents inside.I am fully potty trained. I love my crate!I am learning to walk on a leash, but I pull and try to play tug with it. I am a bit mouthy and need help to curb that behavior.\n\nDoes Stark like other pets?\n\n I have lived with cats prior to my foster and showed little interest. I show a lot of interest in the cats I live with currentlybecause they react to me.I do betterwith female dogsthat are my size.I have shown extreme resource guarding with the large dogs whom I live with currently. I am working on that. Outside of the house, I only show positive interest in all dogs.\n\nDoes Stark like children?\n\n I have only lived with teenagers prior to my foster home. Outside of the home I have not enjoyed watching kids run around. They make me nervous. I'd do best in a home with children 13 years and older.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\n I love rope toys to play tug. I also enjoybones, kongs, and other hard chew toys. I would probably enjoy soft toystoo, but my foster siblings rip soft toys to pieces before I have a chance to play with them.\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n A home with confident, calm, yet active peoplewould be wonderful!Please no apartments for me!I am a Heeler and I have the energy to back it up! I want to use my intelligence and need exercise daily.I would love it if you allow me to go on car rides with you daily because I love the car.I need someone with a lot of patience and someone willing totrain with me especially since I'm deaf! I would love a place that likes cuddles and constant interaction. I bond with my person& quickly and would love to give you all my loyalty and companionship!",

I do not mind baths, the blow dryer and I love being brushed. I get along with other dogs and people. I do like to also roll on my back for brushing but still love attention.  ABSOLUTLEY NO CATS PLEASE.\nI do walk with a limp of sorts which happened along time ago when I was a young puppy, that's what the vets are thinking. The options I have are that I can live with it and have arthritis, get a new hip for my leg to be in or I become  tri pod. Right now I am doing fine not letting it bother me and I am still playing with dogs, getting love and enjoying life. \n\nWill you come and meet me with all my fluff? ",

            "description": "Spunky puppy with a big loving heart!\nHi! My name is Fanta. I'm shy at first around humans but warm up to people faster than you would expect. I am very spunky and will play with dogs of any size! I love to play hard, nap hard and then repeat! I listen well and am learning my basic cues. I am an excellent eater and do mealtime easily with my foster siblings. I don't like walks as my confidence is not high enough yet, but I am curious about trying. I am crate and potty trained, but I am a puppy still and have the occasional accident. My ideal forever home would have a fenced in backyard. Another dog to play with is a must. I'd love a patient family to help build my confidence. Older children, 13 years old and up, are best.\n\nGeneral socialization notes:\n\n I'm shy at first, but warm up quickly with a little patience. Once warmed up, I love belly rubs and head scratches from people. I love other dogs and I learn a lot from them. I like praise more than treats as rewards when learning.I am crate trained and if you grab my crate Kong, I go right in. When you get home, it might take me a minute to come out after opening the door.\n\nDoes Fanta like other pets?\n\nYes, I love other dogs and would do best in a home with another dog or multiple dogs. I play with my foster brother for hours at a time to get nice and exhausted. Then I take long naps to recharge for more play time. I have limited experience with cats and did fine with them.\n\nDoes Fanta like children?\n\nSmall children move too fast and might scare me. I'd do best in a home with children 13 years old and older.\n\nFavorite toys:\n\nI love pretty much all toys, but really like Kongs and antlers. I will de-stuff soft toys if given the chance, but I don't eat the stuffing.\n\nIdeal forever home:\n\n I'll do best in a home with a patient family and other dogs. I am learning a lot from my foster siblings and will continue to learn with you. I'd love a fenced in backyard to be able to run and play in. I'd be fine with cats. I'd be okay with children 13 years old and older.",

I've done really well with other dogs my sizein my foster homes. I'm still learning my manners and I do pull on leash, but I'm working on that.I'd do best in a home with no small dogs or cats. Older children, 8 years and older, would be best.A 6 ft, secure fence is a must!\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I am great with people!I love getting attention. I get very excited when I see dogs while I'm out on a walk.I look forwardto continuing totrain with my human, so I can work on that. I've lived with other dogs close to my sizeand have done well.\n\nDoes Amari like other pets?\n\n I get extremely excited on leashwhen I seeother dogs. It is hard to control my excitement.I might be a bit pushy. Once I get to know a dog friendwith proper introductions, I do well. No small dogs or cats please.\n\nDoes Amari like children?\n\nI may do best with older children, 8 years old and older.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\n Ropes and bones are my favorite! I love burying my bones too.\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n I would love to be ina homewhere Ican take frequent walks andplay ina nice backyard. I wouldn't do well in an apartment.I love being outdoors!I'd enjoyhumans who cangive me lots of attention. Training will be very important for me. I sometimes do not like being alone, but I am doing okay with that. I'd do fine with children, 8 years old and older. I'd do great with anothersocial dog close to my size or I'd also be fine as an only dog.",

I love other dogs!I need to work on some good boy\/be calm manners, but I know how to fetch and sit and always aim to be a sweet boy. Hikes and walks are a lot of fun, and once I have my daily exercise I like to chill out and snooze on the couch. Looking for someone to pamper me and give me lots of attention. I'd do best in a home with older children, 13 years and older. No cats, please.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\nI'm very shy, at first, and need to take it slow to get to know you. Once I warm up, I'm a very sweet boy and I love to be with you.I do jump up and can be a little mouthy when I get excited. I am very smart and would love to continue training. I love treats! I'm also crate trained.\n\nDoes Lorenzo like other pets?\n\n I'd need to go to a home with another social dog. I love dog friends! They help me with building my confidence. I'd do best in a home without cats.\n\nDoes Lorenzo like children?\n\nBecause of my shy nature, I'd do best in a home with children 13 years and older.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\nI love playing fetch and I love stuffed Kongs!\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n I'd need a home that is willing to be patient with me and let me go at my own pace, especially when meeting new people.I most definitely want a dog in my new home to play with and to help me with my confidence.I love to go on long walks and I love water,so I'd enjoy an active family.I'd do best in a home with older children, 13 years and older.",
