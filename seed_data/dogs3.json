I walk pretty well on a leash but I am still a puppy so every step is learning. I do love being near humans and I know sit. I am house trained by walking to the door and sitting by it to let you know its bathroom time. I am good with recall and good with camping as my last family found out. I may also be blind in one eye, the rescue is talking with a vet about it. ",

I do know how to jump fences. I will most likely need a big yard or maybe some acres of land to run and explore but will need boundaries set so I do not run away. I do like to do my own thing sometimes but have gotten friendly with some of the rescues staff, I may be partial to women more then men sometimes. I do like to play with dogs and will need alone time from them to relax and have time to myself. I will take some time to warm up to people but once I do I will follow you around. ",

I do not mind baths, the blow dryer and I love being brushed. I get along with other dogs and people. I do like to also roll on my back for brushing but still love attention.  ABSOLUTLEY NO CATS PLEASE.\nI do walk with a limp of sorts which happened along time ago when I was a young puppy, that's what the vets are thinking. The options I have are that I can live with it and have arthritis, get a new hip for my leg to be in or I become  tri pod. Right now I am doing fine not letting it bother me and I am still playing with dogs, getting love and enjoying life. \n\nWill you come and meet me with all my fluff? ",

Iwouldn't mind a home with other dogs as long as they are calm and let me take play breaks when I get tired. I am a senior, but every now and then I get a burst of energy and like to show off. I especially like walks and playing in the water.\n\nGeneral socialization notes: \n\nI'm very sweet and wellmannered. I may need special care since I have lost my hearing.\n\nDoes Carmel like other pets? \n\nIget along with other calm dogs and have lived with another dog in the past. I'm not a fan of cats though and would prefer a house without one.\n\nDoes Carmel like children? \n\nI would do best with older children.\n\nFavorite toys: \n\nTreat dispensing toys and food puzzle toysare my favorite!\n\nIdeal forever home:\n\nI don't have quite as much pep in my step as I used to, so a home without too many stairs would be best. I would be fine as an only dog or with other dogs, but would like a home without any cats. I enjoy being outsideand would like if my new home had an outdoor space where I could relax and sunbathe.",

I haven't met a person Ididn't like.I'd like a home with another big dog I can play with, but I would also be fine as an only dog. I know all my basics like sit, down, shake,and walking well on leash. I'mpotty trained and crate trained too.I love to learn!\n\nGENERAL SOCIALIZATION NOTES:\n\nI love making new friends and going new places. I like to go to dog friendly restaurants and breweries, or go for walks. I'm an active boy but I also settle well and can be a couch potato between play sessions.\n\nDOES BRUNO LIKE OTHER PETS?\n\nI play well with dogs of all sizes.I haven't met any cats yet so I'm not sure if I like them yet, but the squirrelsat the park can be fun to chase.\n\nDOES BRUNO LIKE CHILDREN?\n\nI love kids!The only problem is that I sometimes forget which toys are mine and which belong to the kids.\n\nFAVORITE TOYS:\n\nEven though I tend to be a couch potato at home, I still like playing at home with my toys, especially if someone will play tugwith me.That's my favorite!It's also fun when one of the toys starts to tear so I can pull all the stuffing out of it, but I know not to eat it.\n\nIDEAL FOREVER HOME:\n\nI think would be my best forever homewould be a mix of going out for more adventures and staying at home and relaxing. I would also like to have a doggy friend at home to play with, but I can do well on my own too. I would like a house with a 4 foot fence to play in, but I think I would also be happy in an apartment if they don't mind me barking on occasion to let them know if someone is walking by. \nMostly, I would like to find a veteran, first responder, or kid I can help. I have already been accepted into the service dog program at Victory Service Dogs and am waiting to find the right partner to start training with.",

I am a bit dog selective so I may do best as an only dog. I also struggle with leash reactivity when I see other dogs on walks. I enjoy playing in the yard, but I need a home with someone who understands my anxiety about dogs on the other side of the fence. Maybe you can teach me that it's ok and I don't have to be afraid.I also really love to chew, so I'd like a home with someone who will spoil me with lots of chew toys and kongs.I'd do fine with older children. I am a sweet girl and would love a family that wants to spend lots of time with me.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\nI'm a very friendly, social girl! I love all people. I am crate trained. I'm very smart and know lots of cues.\n\nDoes Lexie like other pets?\n\nI'd probably do best as an only dog. I can be pretty dog selective. I'm not too sure about cats.\n\nDoes Lexie like children?\n\nI'd do best in a home with older children, 12 years old and older.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\nI love to play ball and I love Stuffed Kongs.\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\nI'd love a home where my humans want to spend time with me and snuggle. I'd do best as an only dog so I can get all the attention! I'd do fine with older children, 12 years old and older. I love to learn, so I'd love to continue training.",

I'm a bit of a velcro dog because Ilike to be with my people and know what they are doing all the time. I am a little anxious being alone and would prefer a home where I amnot left by myself for long. I'm also a great listener and know lots of cues.I love every dog I meet. I do, however, need to be fed separately. Iguard my food so I'd need to work on that. I've lived with older children and did well with them. I'd do best in a home without cats.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I'm a friendly, social guy! I do well with other dogs. I do resource guard a little bit, so I'd need to work on that. I'm very smart and love to train. I'm alsocrate trained.\n\nDoes Dude like other pets?\n\n I love other dogs! I'd enjoy a home with another dog.I'd do best in a home without cats.\n\nDoes Dude like children?\n\nI'd do best in a home with older children, 12 years old and older.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\nI love playing ball! I also love treats of all kinds.\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n I'd love an active family. I'd enjoy a backyard to play in. I'd do fine with other dogs, but no cats please. I also could live with older children. I'm a happy boy and would love a family that loves to spend time with me and go on adventures!",

            "description": "Spunky puppy with a big loving heart!\nHi! My name is Fanta. I'm shy at first around humans but warm up to people faster than you would expect. I am very spunky and will play with dogs of any size! I love to play hard, nap hard and then repeat! I listen well and am learning my basic cues. I am an excellent eater and do mealtime easily with my foster siblings. I don't like walks as my confidence is not high enough yet, but I am curious about trying. I am crate and potty trained, but I am a puppy still and have the occasional accident. My ideal forever home would have a fenced in backyard. Another dog to play with is a must. I'd love a patient family to help build my confidence. Older children, 13 years old and up, are best.\n\nGeneral socialization notes:\n\n I'm shy at first, but warm up quickly with a little patience. Once warmed up, I love belly rubs and head scratches from people. I love other dogs and I learn a lot from them. I like praise more than treats as rewards when learning.I am crate trained and if you grab my crate Kong, I go right in. When you get home, it might take me a minute to come out after opening the door.\n\nDoes Fanta like other pets?\n\nYes, I love other dogs and would do best in a home with another dog or multiple dogs. I play with my foster brother for hours at a time to get nice and exhausted. Then I take long naps to recharge for more play time. I have limited experience with cats and did fine with them.\n\nDoes Fanta like children?\n\nSmall children move too fast and might scare me. I'd do best in a home with children 13 years old and older.\n\nFavorite toys:\n\nI love pretty much all toys, but really like Kongs and antlers. I will de-stuff soft toys if given the chance, but I don't eat the stuffing.\n\nIdeal forever home:\n\n I'll do best in a home with a patient family and other dogs. I am learning a lot from my foster siblings and will continue to learn with you. I'd love a fenced in backyard to be able to run and play in. I'd be fine with cats. I'd be okay with children 13 years old and older.",

I enjoy playing fetch and I will carry my toys in my mouth around the house, I love them so much! I'm still learning my manners and I do pull a bit on leash, but I'm working on that. I know lots of cues and I'm even good at 'settle' on my bed or mat. I do have an allergy to poultry, so I'd need to avoid anything with poultry in it.I'd do best in a home with no children, no cats and I'd also love to be the only dog so I can get all the attention!\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I love people! I love getting lots of attention. I am very smart so I love to train.I do get very excited on leash when I see other dogs, but I'm working on it. I can be a little anxious when left alone at home, but I'm learning.\n\nDoes Zobo like other pets?\n\nI do tend to resource guard with other dogs, so I'd do best as an only dog and no cats, please.\n\nDoes Zobo like children?\n\nI'd do best in a home without children.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\n I love fetch! I chew everything, so I do best withrubber balls. I also enjoy bones and an occasional stuffed toy. I will shred it though!With most of my toys, I will carry them around the house.\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n I would love to be in a home where I can take walks and play in a nice backyard. I love being outside, especially when it snows! I'd love an active family. I would definitely love to continue my training and bond with my new humans.I'd love humans who will give me lots of attention!I'd do best in a home with no small children, no dogs and no cats.",

Being close to my human means a lot to me.Walks are my favorite part of the day and I love running around outside, especiallyin the snow. I've done really well with other dogs my sizein my foster homes. I'm still learning my manners and I do pull on leash, but I'm working on that.I'd do best in a home with no small dogs or cats. Older children, 8 years and older, would be best.A 6 ft, secure fence is a must!\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I am great with people!I love getting attention. I get very excited when I see dogs while I'm out on a walk.I look forwardto continuing totrain with my human, so I can work on that. I've lived with other dogs close to my sizeand have done well.\n\nDoes Amari like other pets?\n\n I get extremely excited on leashwhen I seeother dogs. It is hard to control my excitement.I might be a bit pushy. Once I get to know a dog friendwith proper introductions, I do well. No small dogs or cats please.\n\nDoes Amari like children?\n\nI may do best with older children, 8 years old and older.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\n Ropes and bones are my favorite!

            "description": "Do you want to snuggle and cuddle? I'm your girl!\nI am a very affectionate girl! My favorite thing to do is snuggle on the couch with you! After a nice snuggle, I'd love a longwalk through the neighborhood. I cannot hear, but I am very focused on my person to look for my cues. I know hand signals for all thecues. I do get a little anxious when left alone, so I will need to continue to work on this. I am so smart andvery treat motivated! I may dobest as an only dog or in a home with asocialdog who matches my energy and canhelp me with my manners. No small children or cats please. I'd do best in a home with a backyard. Apartment living would not work well for me.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I am a very lovinggirl! I enjoymeeting new people, but I amworking on my manners. I am called a 'velcro dog' because I love to be with my human(s.) I love to meet new dogs, but I need to learn my manners with them, as well. I am a little too much for most dogs.\n\nDoes Cool Whip like other pets?\n\n I want to meet every dog I see, but I need to learn manners. I can be pushy and have trouble reading other dogs.I may do best as an only dog or with a dog that can help me with my manners. No cats please.\n\nDoes Cool Whip like children?\n\n I'd do best in a home with older children, 13 years old and up. I am very sensitive to sudden movements, so small children may not be best for me.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\nI love to catch balls and frisbees and I love to play tug!\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n I'd need a home where I am not left alone for long periods of time, maybe withsomeone who works from home. I would love a very active family because I love exercise and going out and about in the world. I would also love to learn dog sports, like agility, frisbee or maybenose work. I would need tocontinue to train. I'd do best in a home without cats and no small children.I may also do best in a home as an only dog or in a home with a dog that can help me with my manners.",

I also would love if you threwme a toy. It's one of my favorite things! I can spend hours entertaining myself with throwing my owntoys up in the air. That's a little bit of my goofy side.I'd do best in a home with older children because I have lots of energyandI can be a bit jumpy. I am fine with other dogs,but may do best with dogs that match my high energy.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I do needa little time when meeting new people. I willbark and jump, at first. With yummy treats, I dowarm up quickly. I do, sometimes, chew random objects if they are easy for me to get, but I'm working on that.\n\nDoes Bandit like other pets?\n\n I love other dogs but sometimes, I can be a little much for them. I like to play rough. But, I'd love a buddy that matches my energy! I may do best in a home without cats.\n\nDoes Bandit like children?\n\n I have lived with children, but I may do best in a home with older children, 12 years old and older.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\n If it's a toy, I love it!! Some of my all time favorites though, are kongs, rope toys, bones and balls!\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n I'd love a home with a yard to run and play in. I'd also love a family that loves to spend time with me and cuddle. I'd love to live with another dog, but that dog would need to match my energy and play style, so we could play all day! A home with older children and no cats, would be best.",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Richard, but my foster mom calls me Rico. I've been through some tough stuff in my life, so I am slow at trusting people. What can I say? I'm just picky and want to surround myself with only the bestest of friends. Could that include you? I'd need a home with another dog and cats would be okay too! A home with children 10 years old and up would be best.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n My foster mom says I'm super smart and can learn new stuff pretty quickly. You just need to have lots of treats handy, as I am extremely food motivated. I know how to sit, lay down, shake, give high fives, wave, and touch. I'm working on stay, place, leave\/drop it, and loose leash walking skills and am making great progress! I also love hanging out in my crate because I see it as my own personal safe space.\nI absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE going on walks! When my harness and leash come out, I get so excited! Getting out into the world to explore and adventure with my favorite person is my idea of a good time. I also love riding in the car because it often means I'm going somewhere for a walk!\n\n\nDoes Richard like other pets?\n\n My high energy is unmatched. I could play for HOURS and never get sick of it. Though I'm slow to trust humans, I adore my fellow doggy friends. I would prefer a home with another high energy dog so we could play and play and play! In my foster home, I live with a female rescue who also loves to play. We spend our days running around in the yard, chewing on each other, and wrestling. I love being with her! I can be a little pushy when playing, but I'm also getting better at knowing when my playmate is tired and needs a break.\nPlaying is my passion, so much so that I even often try to play with my foster mom's cats. I know they are small, so I approach as carefully as I can, but they still hiss at me. That's okay though. I know the hiss means I should leave them alone. But maybe I can try again later? Foster mom is so proud of me for how well I can interact with the kitties. I also spend time in her bedroom with her rats and I like those guys too!\n\nDoes Richard like children?\n\nAnother thing you should know about me is that I like routine and knowing what to expect. Because of this, I don't think I'd feel very comfortable in a home with little kids, as I know they can be pretty unpredictable. I live with a nine-year-old girl in my foster home, but she's pretty calm and leaves me alone. I like that energy, but I know most other kids are different.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\nMy favorite toys are basically anything I'm not supposed to play with. I prefer playing with paper products around the house, but I'm slowly learning how to appreciate my stuffed toys instead. I also like playing with snuffle mats, puzzle toys, and frozen kongs, but can get bored with them after a while. I need someone who can keep me active and entertained throughout the day!\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n I'dlove a quiet home where not many visitors come through. Once I've adjusted to my routine, change can be scary for me. Plus, as I mentioned, I'm fearful of new people, so I'd rather just spend a lot of time with the family I already know and trust.I know I can be antisocial, but I can be a total cuddle bug with the right person. So far, I only fully trust one person, but I'd like to have more friends. Show me patience and understanding, and I'm sure I'll come to love you Please consider giving me a chance to be your new best friend!",

            "description": "I can't wait to meet my new best friend!\nI'm a sensitive, gentle soul who has been through difficult times. It takes me a long while to trust. But once I feel comfortable, I am an easygoing, playful, goofy guy! My favorite thing to do is cuddle on the couch or in bed with you and sprawl out on my back. In the morning I am so excited for the day, I might even give you kisses! I'd do fine with other dogs and may do best in a home with older children, 13 years old and older.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n Although I like to share space with people, I'm not used to this 'petting' thing. It can be startling when someone reaches out toward me. I also have had really scary experiences with the leash, and will need a lot of time to work on this. I walk very nicely and enjoy myself once I'm on the leash, though! I will need time to warm up to new people.\n\nDoes Jasper like other pets?\n\nI love other dogs and communicate with them very well. If they are too pushy with me, it makes me afraid, so I would love another nice friendly dog to play with. I'm very respectful of cats.\n\nDoes Jasper like children?\n\n I haven't had a chance to meet children yet at my foster home. Due to my shy nature, I may do best with older children.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\nI don't know how to play with toys yet. But I love a good Kong with peanut butter or plain yogurt - I will do anything for yogurt!\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n I will need an experienced best friend to bond with who is patient, quiet and kind. I will need to continue having positive experiences with new people and places throughout my life to stay happy and socialized. I'd do great in a home with another, social dog and in a home with older children or no children.",

I might be the smartest dog you meet, and I have so much love to give. I have been through a lot, so please help mefeel happy andsafe,and get to know me!Because I still need training, I'd do best as the only dogin a home with no cats, no younger children-13 years old and older, please.I am alsosensitive when a harness is being wrapped around me, we are working on this in small increments so it is not so scary. I am doing really well with this!If Iget uncomfortable, you may notice my body language change, and if my boundaries are stillcrossed I may 'mouth' you to show that I don't like that.My new home will be a patient and kind single person or couple, ideally experienced and comfortable with giving me stability and training I need. I can't wait to meet you, and become the best dog I can be!\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I am a sweet girl and I love people! I am reactive on leash to other dogs. It is very scary to me, and I would need to continue working on that with my new humans. I can also be a bit mouthy. I'm working on my impulse control, but I am eager to please!\n\nDoes Nola like other pets?\n\nI'd do fine with a social dog in the home, my size or larger. I'm 45 lbs. A home without cats or small dogs would be best for me.\n\nDoes Nola like children?\n\n I'd do best in a home with older children, 13 years old and older. No small children.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\nI love to chew so I love chew toys!Bones are my favorite.\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n I'd need a family that has the time to train and work with me. I need structures and boundaries and help with reactivity on leash.I'm a really good girl with lots of potential. I'd love a big backyard to run and play in. Idon't think I'd do well in an apartment.I'd do best with a dog my size or as an only dog.Older children would be best for me, 13 years old and older. No cats or small dogs, please.",

I love other dogs!I need to work on some good boy\/be calm manners, but I know how to fetch and sit and always aim to be a sweet boy. Hikes and walks are a lot of fun, and once I have my daily exercise I like to chill out and snooze on the couch. Looking for someone to pamper me and give me lots of attention. I'd do best in a home with older children, 13 years and older. No cats, please.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\nI'm very shy, at first, and need to take it slow to get to know you. Once I warm up, I'm a very sweet boy and I love to be with you.I do jump up and can be a little mouthy when I get excited. I am very smart and would love to continue training. I love treats! I'm also crate trained.\n\nDoes Lorenzo like other pets?\n\n I'd need to go to a home with another social dog. I love dog friends! They help me with building my confidence. I'd do best in a home without cats.\n\nDoes Lorenzo like children?\n\nBecause of my shy nature, I'd do best in a home with children 13 years and older.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\nI love playing fetch and I love stuffed Kongs!\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n I'd need a home that is willing to be patient with me and let me go at my own pace, especially when meeting new people.I most definitely want a dog in my new home to play with and to help me with my confidence.I love to go on long walks and I love water,so I'd enjoy an active family.I'd do best in a home with older children, 13 years and older.",

Thank you to Blue's Natural Pet Market & Dog Wash for sponsoring Oreo, bringing down his adoption fee to just $100!*** I am an energetic and playful boy! I am also super sweet and love to cuddle and get pets.I am happy as long as my people are with me and loving on me. I like to walk, but get distractedeasily and need some help learning myleash skills. But I am a super smart boy, especiallyif you give me some cream cheese! I love to learn new tricks. I struggle with moving objects on walks, such as big cars or bikes.I would love a home with a big fenced yard for me to sniff and play in. I would dobest in a home withno other dogs or cats. I'd also do best in a home with children 13 years old and older.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I'd do best asanonly dog and withno cats either. I love my peopleand love to cuddle and get loved on! I am house trained and am learning my basic cues. I do jump up sometimes when I am excited to see someone. I am getting better at walking on a leash, but moving objects and other dogs are hard for me.\n\nDoes Oreo like other pets?\n\n I would need to be the only dog in the house. I think I'd do best in a home without cats either.\n\nDoes Oreo like children?\n\n I am not too sure how Iwould do with children, but I am big and sometimes jump or run fast so older children, 13years old and older, would be best.\n\nFavorite Toys:\nI like to play Tug and sometimes chase a ball. But my absolute favorite toy is a flirt pole to chase around!\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n I want a home with people who love to cuddle and spend time withme. I like a lot of attention! I would love a home with a big fenced backyard to sniff and play in. I need to be the only dog and no cats please. I would do bestwith older children, 13 years old and older.",

            "description": "Can we do everything together?\nI am looking for my forever best friend! My personality is the epitome of what it means to be a Heeler. I want to be around my person and alwaystouching them when we are together. I love to play tug, chew bones, and get exercise. If I can cuddle while doing so, even better! Most importantly, I LOVE CARS! I always want to hop in the car or truck.I am afraid of new experiences, but I am brave. As long as I can smell around, I will warm up to the new person, place, or thing. Although I am deaf, I constantly check in and read the social cues given by people and other animals, aswell. I'd do best in a home with children 13 years and older. Please no apartments for me, I can bark a bit and we thinkI may get in trouble in an apartment!\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I have lived with cats and older children. I do fine with some dogs, but will need a slow introduction and very specific boundaries in the house as I tend to guard resources. While outside on a leash, I have only shown positive interest in other dogs. When I am uncomfortable with another dog, I will warn them with a low growl.Typically, I warm up quickly after my warning. I have not had any accidents inside.I am fully potty trained. I love my crate!I am learning to walk on a leash, but I pull and try to play tug with it. I am a bit mouthy and need help to curb that behavior.\n\nDoes Stark like other pets?\n\n I have lived with cats prior to my foster and showed little interest. I show a lot of interest in the cats I live with currentlybecause they react to me.I do betterwith female dogsthat are my size.I have shown extreme resource guarding with the large dogs whom I live with currently. I am working on that. Outside of the house, I only show positive interest in all dogs.\n\nDoes Stark like children?\n\n I have only lived with teenagers prior to my foster home. Outside of the home I have not enjoyed watching kids run around. They make me nervous. I'd do best in a home with children 13 years and older.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\n I love rope toys to play tug. I also enjoybones, kongs, and other hard chew toys. I would probably enjoy soft toystoo, but my foster siblings rip soft toys to pieces before I have a chance to play with them.\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\n A home with confident, calm, yet active peoplewould be wonderful!Please no apartments for me!I am a Heeler and I have the energy to back it up! I want to use my intelligence and need exercise daily.I would love it if you allow me to go on car rides with you daily because I love the car.I need someone with a lot of patience and someone willing totrain with me especially since I'm deaf! I would love a place that likes cuddles and constant interaction. I bond with my person& quickly and would love to give you all my loyalty and companionship!",

            "description": "Can we play?\nI am a happy boyand I love to play with my friends, whether they are human or dogs!I sometimes am a little nervousmeeting new people, and I am also nervouswhen new people come to the door. I will get more training to help me with this! When I am home, I love getting pet and will snuggle up close to get belly rubs. Smelling things is my favorite hobby, whether it be around the house or on walks. I love to be outside exploring the sights and the sounds of the yard. I get very excited when I see other dogs while on walks and I want to go up to them and say hello. If I get too overwhelmed, however, I can be pretty noisy. I'm an adventurer at heart, so if I am left alone outside too long, I may get bored and decide to go explore the neighborhood, despite the fence.I'd dobest in a home withchildren 13 years and older. Another dog is a must!\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes:\n\n I'm a sweet boy and a little shy meeting new people. I do warm up quickly. I like my crate, especially if there is food inside. I love to play with other dogs. I am a smart boy and will love to continue training.\n\nDoes Sheriff like other pets?\n\nI absolutely love to play with other dogs, it's one of my favorite things! We can get loud and rambunctious but it's all in good fun. I gotreally excited when I saw a cat on one of my walks and would need to figure out how I feel about them before committing to living with one.\n\nDoes Sheriff like children?\n\nI haven't met any children while I've been with my fosters, but I like to jump, chase, and gently nip when I'm excited, so I'd probably do best around children over 13.\n\nFavorite Toys:\n\nI like Kongs stuffed with my favorite foods, and NylaBones. Tennis balls are also fun to chase but I'd prefer to be playing with another dog or human instead of an inanimate object!\n\nIdeal Forever Home:\n\nMy ideal foreverhome would have another dog who likes to play, and a yard with at least a six foot fence! I am learning how to work for treats, and I would like to continue my undergrad in good boy-ism! A home without cats or small children would be ideal, along with a family who has a lot of love (and belly rubs) to give!",

            "description": "PAW-sitively Adorable!\n***Generously sponsored by Mama Walks Dogs, making Tina's adoption fee just $100! Check outTina's feature in our Virtual Adoption Fair!*** I am a smart, active girl who likes to jump, play,run, and WORK! Give me a job and I will perform it diligently. I have great focus and I know lots of tricks ..I would love to learn some more. I am nervous around new people and I am still learning some manners, but I love to go for long walks, car rides, or to sleep in the lounge chair with my human. I'd prefer a home with a huge yard and no other dogs or cats please.\n\nDoes Tina like other pets?\n\nWhen I see other dogs out on a walk, I am not sure what to do! I bark at them, and I think I want to play, but then I'm unsure. I am going for some training to help me decide.\n\nGeneral socialization notes:\n\nI needlots of attention and exercise!I am wary of new people and will bark at them. If they are quiet and don't pay attention to me, I get used to them. Men take a little longer to warm up to,unless they are quiet and calm. I respond well to treats and redirection. I can jump really high and if you leave food out on the counter, I just have to jump up and get it. .\n\nDoes Tina like children?\n\n I love olderchildren! I love to chase them and herd them, and I feel it is my duty to watch over them. I do jump up on them, so kids over 12would be best.\n\nFavorite toys?\n\nMy favorite toy is a plastic milk jug. I tear up stuffed toys and squeakers in minutes. My foster Mom has found lots of good Kong toys for me to keep me busy.\n\nIdeal forever home\n\n I need a family who will be with me a lot and will keep my brain and body active. I need lots of room to run so a yard would be wonderful, and I would love to be your hiking partner! I would like a family who will play games with me and maybe take me for some fun classes so I don't get bored at home. I'd prefer a home with a backyard.",

Be sure to check out her feature in the Virtual Adoption Fair!*** I ama young, silly, affectionate girl who has been living in a kennel for far too long. While I doneed some time to warm up to new people, once you are myfriend I will be your buddy for life. I ama favorite among staff, students and volunteers alike!I just need that one person who will take the time to get to know me for the lovely girl I am. I don't like to be alone for long periods of time, I love to stick close by my humans. I love playing ball! Apartment living is not for me.\n\nGeneral Socialization Notes: \n\n I stickclose by my humans, and I don't like to be left alone for long periods.I would be a great companion for someone who works from home, or is retired.I am a strong girl but our students and volunteers have worked hard to teach me some manners. Now, I walklovely on leash! I sometimes bark at other dogs or humans when out walking, but I ameasily redirected with simple cues.\n\nDoes Scarlett like other pets?\n\nI'd do best in a home without other dogs and nocats.\n\nDoes Scarlett like children?\n\n While I have played nicely with appropriate children, I can become overly excited.Because I sometimesforgetwhat a big girl I am, a home with no children would be best for me.\n\nFavorite toys?\n\n I love to chase a ball (sometimes I'll even bring it back to you!)or chew on a squeaky toy. Kongs and other durable bones are great, too.\n\nIdeal Forever Home: \n\n I'm a total sweetheartwho wants to find someone who will love me as much as I love them. My perfect family will be patient with me as I adjust to life in a home. I'd do best in a house, not an apartmentand I'd love a fenced back yard to play in.I'd love someone who can be with me a lot and who will continue my training to help me be confident and well mannered as I learn to trust that they are mine forever.",

Especially for someone who wants a dog with lots of energy! He is the most active of his siblings but super silly and ready for live and cuddling when play time is over. Also gets along with other dogs and adults. Don't know about kids but guessing yes. Big appetite and growing into a big dog. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.elpasocountycanine.org\/adopt\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org\/adopt\n\n\\r\\n",

Very friendly with other dogs and loves playing with his sibling. Like all also loves playing in the water but when the hose goes on he will run away! Just like Jack Frist, playful but a hero and full of love at heart. \n\n \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org\/adopt\n\n\\r\\n",

            "description": "Meet 3 month boy Aster. He is the next calmest dog of the 4 siblings. Still very energetic though and needs someone who has time to give lots of walks, playtime, attention, and most of all love. I have not seen him around kids but he gets along with other dogs. I will give you a heads up that his paws are the biggest of the bunch and none of them have small paws ! I'm guessing he will get to be about 75 pounds but that is fully just based on his current overall weight (little over 30 pounds) and paw size. He acts super tough like Aster the bunny but then deep down just wants to lick you on the nose and stay by your side. He always naps right next to me unless I have to put him in the crate for the night or when I leave. Mostly potty train but had a mini accident when I didn't open the back door quick enough. Overall full of love!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org\/adopt\n\n\\r\\n",

            "description": "Are you looking for a pair of 1 year old pitties? Sometimes all you need is a pair to make a full house! Meet Lucas (white male) and Ripley (tan and white female) From Lucas and Ripley-please consider letting us be part of your family. We don't know why we have been returned as we are eager to please and love our humans. We know we have our faults but we think if our human reinforces our training and is consistent we will do better as we have forgotten a little throughout our travels but our foster mom is reminding us what we already know. So far we remember sit, down and place. Stay and come seem familiar but with the excitement of the new digs we don't always get that right yet. We think there is more in our block heads somewhere. Please give us a chance. These kids were adopted together at a young age and were returned by a heart broken owner as her situation had changed and for the betterment of the puppies had to let them go. While she had them, they were professionally trained as Lucas is partially deaf and has learned the ropes from Ripley so they are a bonded pair. They are house trained, both love people big and small and good with dogs that are their size with proper introductions. They DO NOT do well with small animals. Please consider these kids, they are very sweet.\n\n \n\nwww.elpasocountycanine.org\/adopt\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org\/adopt",

            "description": "Hi! My name is Nymera and I am a 6 month old mix. I am equal parts loving and crazy. I love getting cuddles at all times, but after I burn off my energy. This includes doing laps in the yard (and house) while wrestling with all of the dogs and humans in the process. I am a bit of a talker outside and like to announce my presence to everyone. I mean no harm since I just enjoy talking in general. I want cats to be my friend, but I tend to get overenthusiastic about loving them so they run away. I love kids and will greatly enjoy licking their faces whenever I can. I am not a fan of my crate even though my foster mom tried really hard to get me to like it. I can be pushy at meal time, but its easily fixed by just feeding me while supervising me so I don't try to eat anyone else's food. I would be a great outdoors activities companion since I love being outside most of the time. Please take me home with you!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org\/adopt",

            "description": "Mactavish is a 2 year old Chihuahua, Schipperke mix and is potty trained. A little firecracker who also enjoys laying on the couch and napping. He loves chasing red dot lasers and playing tug of war, and he will also completely protect you from the vacuum. He will kiss you to death and when he's not getting the attention he wants he will let you know by pawing at you. Special needs: His occasional seizures (once a month or less) will make him dazed for 10-15 mins afterwards, He needs a place to pace after a seizure, as well as extra love as his body will be tired. He's a sweet pup who will love you unconditionally. Good with all children and good with dogs. Neutered and up to date with shots.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org\/adopt\n\n\\r\\n",

While it takes time to earn his trust, once you do he is super loyal and will want to follow you everywhere. Woody has been working on training to help his confidence and reactivity around new people and has proven a very quick learner. He has learned place and sit, and we are working on leash training. Woody warms up more quickly to women than men, and excels when he has another more confident dog to take comfort from. Due to his timid nature should not be in a home with young children. If you are looking for a goofy, energetic partner and are willing to put in a little extra effort, Woody will be the most loyal companion you could ask for!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org\/adopt",

            "description": "Hello, my name is Quinn and I'm 2 years old in April (DOB 04\/12\/2020). I came from Texas in October. I wasn't lucky in Texas and got bounced around from one foster to another. I got adopted but returned because I didn't eat. My adopter probably didn't know that my breed are picky eaters. I'm finally in Colorado and looking for my forever home. It's also my second foster home in Colorado. I'm currently in a home with 3 other dogs and I get along fine with them. I need a big yard and a high fence. I love to have another sibling so I can play and snuggle with. I'm crate trained, potty trained know my name and the sit command. I'm sleeping in the crate just fine but also enjoy to sleep on a dog bed in the bedroom. MEDICAL: As you can see one eye is bigger than the other. I went to the eye specialist for it and I got Glaucoma. I'm blind in that eye and have nerve damage. However, I am not in any pain! I recently had a test to determine that I may also go blind in my other eye, and it has shown that I may go blind in my other eye as well..However, I'm currently on eye drops for both eyes and if I do go blind in my other eye it will happen within the next year (we've been told). Due to the fact that I got bounced around a lot I'm hoping I will finally get my furever home! Do you wanna be my furever home?\n\n \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org\/adopt",

            "description": "Hi, I'm Miles! I am a super sweet 3+ year-old, 60 - 65 lbs. Blue Nose American Staffordshire Terrier boy who was surrendered by my owner in Cortez, CO, who couldn't take care of and keep me anymore. Even though they lost their home, they still loved me very much and wanted to make sure I found the very best home, so they asked El Paso County Canine Rescue to find me one! I love snuggles, long walks, and playing with my foster brothers and sister. I also relax by sitting on the couch watching TV when I am not playing inside. I am very curious, energetic, strong, love car rides and potty trained. I am very interested in everything going on outside, and as my previous parents said, I follow my nose, and this gets me into situations where I can't find my way back home, so it is paramount I have a secure backyard and I am always on a leash when out and about. That isn't to say I want to run away I am just a very curious boy. I am crate trained but prefer to be with my people and play. I know my name and respond well to it but could use some training time to learn the basics of dog\/owner behavior. I would do great with an active single, couple, or couple with older children. I am not good with cats or small furry creatures. I eat alone or in my crate and would have to take it slow if I eat with a future brother or sister. I am looking for my furever' home where I can give you all the love I have in my heart, which is as big as my pibble head! Up to date on shots, chipped and neutered.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org\/adopt",

I will need a slow introduction with another dog in the home, and would prefer to be your only fur-baby! I am leash trained, I don't pull at all when you walk me, I am kennel trained, and I know how to sit and shake hands! I like kids too! I wish I had a yard I could run and play in, and a family to love furever! If this sounds like you, choose me to be your new best friend! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting, please visit our website and complete an adoption application at www.elpasocountycanine.org\/adopt",

            "description": "Horchata is a little 40 lb black and white Pit Bull mix who has amazing eyes and who within the last 6 months had babies. She is listed as a 3 yr old. She is completely vetted and ready for her forever home. She is very mellow but will stand on her back legs and shake her tail when she sees her human. She loves to get on the couch with you and climb in your lap and give you kiss's. She loves to be loved. She is crate trained and walks GREAT on a leash. Completely house broken. Rarely barks (Only if she hears something outside). Have not seen any aggression with people or other dogs. Not sure about cats, but does bark at cows and horses (shows more interest then aggression-don't think she has ever seen cows\/horses. This is one of the sweetest most loving little girls I have had the pleasure of fostering. She will make a great addition to any family ready to add a furbaby.

Fostered with a variety of different dogs and have done well.  Miranda So young but very inquisitive about everything. Doing well with sit, down and sometimes paw when she's focused. Puppy brain makes her forget and run to the toys. Really loves playing with our Rottweiler even if he is sometimes grumpy. When the other dogs bark it does scare her for a minute, but I will encourage her to see it's okay and she will watch them. She likes to watch the cows from the dog run, not sure what they are and when birds fly she wants to catch them.  She is a bit of a digger and trying to work on not doing that. Very, very sweet and just loves to be around anyone human or dog. Will also play by her self for a little bit. Trying to work on taking treats nicer as to she does grab them rough and if your not expecting it it can hurt with those puppy teeth. She goes potty outside,  but still forgets and will go inside if not taken out. Knows the dog door well\nhttps:\/\/www.fromforgottentoforever.com\/fosterapplication\/",

Tests the big dogs with playing like she is 10 times bigger then them lol. Doing good with sit, down and working on paw. Knows the dog door well, but still working on using it to go outside to go potty. She is scared when big dogs  bark. She is a big time lover most of the time. If i ask her for a kiss she will nose my nose and give me kisses, if she's not all riled or distracted. \nhttps:\/\/www.fromforgottentoforever.com\/fosterapplication\/",

She enjoys playing with toys as well as the other dogs in foster care, and exploring the yard. She adores getting attention and will come jump in your lap when you sit down. She tends to just relax while she is being held as opposed to wiggling and trying to play. She sleeps well in her crate at night. Kid and cat testing is available but she is young enough that with some time and work she should integrate into any home.  Apply to adopt at fromforgottentoforever.com\/adoptionapplication\/.",

I am social, brave, and curious. I love playing with my brother Mark and the big dogs in our foster home. I\u2019m great with cats too! I have almost mastered potty training and am using puppy pads reliably. Because I will be a bigger boy and I love the fresh air, I\u2019m looking for a home with a yard. I would love a family of my own to take me for walks! If  Mike is your type of guy please apply at https:\/\/www.fromforgottentoforever.com\/adoptionapplication\/",

I am very sweet, smart, and funny. I love playing with my brother Mike and the big dogs in our foster home. I\u2019m great with cats too! I have almost mastered potty training and am using puppy pads reliably. Because I will be a bigger boy and I love the fresh air, I\u2019m looking for a home with a yard. I would love a family of my own to take me for walks! If Mark is your type of guy please apply at https:\/\/www.fromforgottentoforever.com\/adoptionapplication\/",

She likes to chase kitties, and playing with her toys. She begs for your attention and loves to give kisses. She's scared to death of fly swatters and runs and hides when you pick one up. She's good with other dogs big and small once she gets to know them, but can be protective and jealous also.  She was running in traffic around a 6 way intersection with a railroad crossing as well. We believe she was abused and dumped there. She has scaring on her leg from the abuse she's suffered. She'll make anyone a great companion. If Vienna seems like a good fit please apply at  https:\/\/www.fromforgottentoforever.com\/adoptionapplication\/",

I originally marketed Miss Piggy for a foster home to try and get her out of the shelter in May 2021, at which time she had already been a long-term resident. I wasn't successful. \nI just saw that she is STILL THERE. So I'm going to try again.\nHere is the description I received of her:\nShe makes the cutest noises! She was a stray, small pit mix found by Monte Vista animal control just roaming and injured. Due to her condition and behavior we think she was involved in dog fights somehow. When walking into or out of any doorway she does a low stalking walk. At the fence with a set of puppies she all loose and wiggles trying to play. She does well with dogs her size (45#) or smaller as long as properly introduced. Her behavior with people, including kids, is absolutely the best! Loves everybody she's introduced to and immediately a lap dog. We believe she's approximately 2 years old and she's already been spayed, and is up to date on Parvo\/Distemper and dewormer.\nApply to foster at fromforgottentoforever.com\/fosterapplication\/. All expenses paid and first choice for adoption. She is currently at Conour Animal Shelter in Monte Vista. I'll transport her anywhere I can get to and from in a day.",

            "description": "My name is Tink. I am a 6 month old Chihuahua. When my owner realized I was partially blind they didn\u2019t want me anymore. My mom was too old to have puppies but got pregnant. I was the only puppy. I can see shadows and can get around my foster home quite well in every\nroom. I get along well with my foster brother who is also a puppy, but bigger. I don\u2019t like really big dogs as much. They make me nervous. I love to play and prance in the yard. My foster mom laughs and calls me Prancer. Being sight impaired doesn\u2019t seem to bother me. I  am very loving, sweet and able. Foster Mom also calls me sweet Tink. She says I have a sweet spirit and gives me lots of hugs. I am on a schedule for sleeping and eating. I sleep in a kennel at night (but would be happy to sleep with you) and only need to go out to potty about 5:00 AM or so. I will let you know if I need to go sooner. I go potty outside\nevery time I am taken out, but sometimes have an accident in the house\u2026I\u2019m still learning. I need to be in a home where my owner can be home with me most of the time. I stay in a playpen if Foster Mom is gone for 2-3 hours just fine. Four hours or longer alone would be too much.  He's so sweet and will be a blessing to anyone who can be home more with him. He does well in the doggie purse and he loves being carried around he\u2019s a good little traveler.

He's already fixed, his shots are up to date.  Wojo is dog friendly with proper intros and people friendly. Wojo is alert\/cautious on walks, does not pull toward distractions easy to walk.  Wojo gets a bit nervous in new situations, but is willing to experience new things with guidance and supervision. He enjoys other dogs, but his preference is to be with one other dog.\n He seems to like friendlier, submissive type dogs the most. No cats for this guy. Kids that are older as he likes to jump and might be to ruff of younger\/ smaller kids or older people.  Wojo Kennels up well and does great on a leash. Wojo is truly happiest when he is on a walk or hike which he does at a leisurely pace.

            "description": "Asher is super sweet, a big cuddle bug. He is still learning his name, he is house trained and knows sit. He is very smart and learns quickly. He is very food aggressive towards other dogs, but we have been able to feed him in the same room with our other dogs, seperated, as long as a human is in there and able to navigate the situation so I think it could be trained out of him pretty easily. I talked with a couple trainers and they confirmed that he could be trained to not be food aggressive. He does have pretty bad separation anxiety but does decent in a kennel if there are other dogs nearby. He is a huge lovebug and just wants to follow you around the house and play with the other dogs. He is super good with kids and dogs. He is very trainable with time and consistency. He is learning to walk on a leash. He is truly a puppy in that he chews on stuff and has the puppy energy.

            "description": "Retirement home needed! \nHey there, I\u2019m Arnold. \n\nI\u2019m a blind and deaf, easy going senior. I was found wandering the streets in Denver City, Texas. I was brought into the shelter there and no one came looking for me. Doc believes I\u2019m 10-12 years old. Don\u2019t let the blind\/deaf disability turn you away. It doesn\u2019t impact me \u2014 except sometimes I bonk into stuff. \n\nThe rescue believes I\u2019m Chihuahua mix. \n\nHere\u2019s a bit about me: \n\n-I enjoy rides in the stroller and short walks outside ???\n-I may not be able to see or hear you but I sure as heck will love and snuggle with you?\n-I need a good easy going home to spend the rest of my life. I\u2019ll repay you with my soft smile. \n-Doc says I\u2019m a healthy senior. I will have dental work done prior to going to my forever home. Also my ears have chronic infections (after assumed years of no care) but I\u2019m on drops now and it\u2019s expected to clear up!?????\n-I\u2019m about 27lbs and neutered ??\n-I\u2019m potty trained to an extent. Once I know I\u2019m outside I understand it\u2019s time to go. Foster mom keeps a belly band on me because sometimes I don\u2019t realize I\u2019m inside. ?\n-I like other dogs\u2026 sometimes I bonk into them ??\n-Fine with cats ?\n-I\u2019m not sure how I am with small humans (kids) based on how easy going I am I think it would be no problem ??????\n-I\u2019m great in the car ?\n-I don\u2019t mind my crate and I\u2019m ok at sleeping there at night but would love to snuggle in bed as long as I\u2019m safely up there. I don\u2019t want to fall off ?\n-My foster family says I\u2019m the best\/easiest going guy. They sometimes forget I\u2019m here. I just need a second chance and a great place to snooze 20+ hours a day for the rest of my life?? \n\nMy adoption fee is $200.00. That covers pre-adoption medical costs, microchip, dental and transportation.\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t bark. Sometimes I whine if I sense foster mom is home and she hasn\u2019t come to check on me. I love to snooze. I\u2019ll go outside and go potty. Come back in. Walk around a bit then go to sleep.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting me, want to setup a meet & greet or have more questions let Fromm Rescue To Forever know at \u2014-> frommrescuetoforever@gmail.com or at 303-912-0852.",

She's a big girl at 75 pounds and will need an owner that is an experienced dog owner who can be firm but gentle. She has been through some trauma and lost her owner to a terminal illness, then shifted around. She's been with a foster that has worked hard to help Ivy overcome her trauma. She is very intelligent, knows basic commands, is halter trained, and is a lovable loyal dog. She loves playing ball, going on walks and car rides, being active, watching tv (that's right she watches tv) and snuggling her blanket. Ivy is not good with other animals however and given her size she will need a secure home with no other dogs or cats. Older children 12+ recommended. She also comes with a free training class to keep her good progress moving forward.",

            "description": "Tallie is an active Red Australian Shepherd about 5 years old. She was part of a hoarding case, living outdoors with minimal care or shelter. She has blossomed into a lovely attentive, active gal , eager to go and do whatever you are willing to take her for.  She rides well in the car, and likes to hitch a ride on the ATV going for chores. She has been good with the other similar sized dogs in her foster home but her antics can be a bit much for small dogs. Tallie sleeps in a large sized crate at night, comes when called reliably, stays behind a fence,  is not a digger or a barker but is showing she knows her yard and will bark at the Fed eX guy making our Chewy.dom delivery! She is a genuine companion and wants attention and to be loved on. Tallie had an old eye injury in her left eye when we got her and she has limited or no vision in that eye but the veterinarian did a thorough check and found no scratches or infection and Tallie has learned to compensate for that most of the time. On occasion you will notice she bumps into something on that side.  But it does not slow her down, she is interested in fetching, does great with livestock, responds well to direction and has good recall.  Likes plush toys and antllers to chew on and loves the water and her wading pool! Good on leash and off. Tallie's best home would be an active,  person, couple or family with older kids that have some previous dog training experience to help Tallie continue to learn what living in a home is,   willing to accomodate her sight limitations and keep her safe while giving her the love and time she so deserves.  Tallie is fostered in Lamar, CO and will be adopted from her foster home. ",

            "description": "Charlie is a lovely purebred Cavalier King Charles Spaniel about 8 years old. She is sweet as can be and loves to be with you, in her doggie bed napping or just chilling. Charlie was found by a fisherman at a remote reservoir during a rainstorm. She was filthy, matted and her eyes were almost matted shut. She has a microchip but no amount of searching or investigative work was able to turn up an owner. We have had Charlie awhile, treating her for eye infection, health issues, and a heart murmur. Charlie is stable now and really enjoying life! She is good with other dogs, does well in the house, sleeps in her crate  at night and will search out her crate when she is sleepy during the day, so the door is open or will sleep in a dog bed. Charlie rides well in the car and likes a snuggle on the couch in the evening. Likes to be carried and not a squirmer. We think she might have been a breeding dog and does carry some of the maladies of the breed. Charlie has dry eye and a heart murmur both manaaged well with medicine which has an out of pocket expense of about $70 a month. She takes her medicine well\/easily too. The dry eye and the eye infection she had when we found her has left her short sighted, but she compensates by air scenting for you when outdoors. Her hearing is negligible but for all her shortcomings she is a lovely, ever so sweet and always HAPPY, HAPPY HAPPY  little dog. Cutest snufflely snore ever!  She does well with the older dogs in her foster home and looks to them for whats going on and will lie quietly in the sun together  or follow them around outdoors. Charlie also follows you around, but can lose sight of you so she requires an attentive human and safe yard for her safety.  Happiest dog ever! A quieter home, willing and able to provide for her medical needs, with no small children or active dogs that can run over her is  a must. Fostered in Lamar CO and will be adopted out of her foster home.  ",

I love to play with other dogs, although a slow introduction would probably be best. I may do best in a home without other small animals. I'm not sure about cats yet. I am potty trained, but sometimes I do need reminders. I absolutley LOVE to play fetch, and I know my name and will come when called. I came to the shelter with a broken leg for which I received surgery to repair. I was then sent to a foster home for recovery and have been doing great with my physical therapy exercises! It is highly recommended to discuss with your primary care veterinarian for further monitoring\/follow up care.** I am currently not at the shelter but spending time in a loving foster home while I recover from my injury and continue to work on physical therapy. Please contact my foster mom, Sam, at Samross0213@gmail.com to inquire about me or set up a visit. Please allow up to 24 hours for Sam to respond.",

            "description": "Meet Arlo! Arlo is an amazing dog who was found on the streets of Houston and taken to the city pound. He joined the Joyrides family and is now blossoming in his foster home! Arlo loves walks, people, head scratches and treats! He is instant friends with everyone he meets and at home he is calm, low-key and quiet. Although when he does get excited (dinnertime!) he does the cutest little hops! Sounds about perfect! Arlo can be shy in new situations and is looking for a family who will be patient with him and provide him reassurance as he builds up his confidence. Arlo is pretty ambivalent about dogs (he basically ignores them) - but dislikes dogs who are ill-mannered and pushy. He will do best as an only dog or in a home with another low-key dog who isn't looking for a playmate. If you'd like to meet this handsome boy, email info@joyrides.org to request an app!\n\nArlo is being fostered in Houston, TX. He would come to his new home via professional transport. \n\nAge : 5-6 yrs\nWeight: 60 lbs\nNeeds fenced in yard? Not necessarily\nDogs: Best with calm, older dogs\nCats: no cats please!\nKids: Would do best with adults\/older kids because he can get scared at times with loud noises\nEnergy level (scale of 1-10): 4\nVaccinated: yes\nSpayed\/Neutered: yes\nMicrochipped: yes\nOther considerations: Arlo needs a patient family who understands he's still getting used to being safe!",

When the rescue brought me this joyful little bundle of adorable puppyness, they told me his mother was an Akita but the didn't know what Dad was.  I searched the internet for pictures of mixed breed Akitas to see if any of them looked similar but none of them did.  I'm not one to give up easy so I continued searching for pictures that looked like this little ball of happy furry teeth.  I believe I have now discovered the truth of their paternal lineage.... this littler of pups is clearly a cross between an Akita and a Red Fox.  For some reason the rescue keeps telling me that this isn't possible, something about \"genetics\" and \"science\", but I'm pretty sure I'm right.  Come see any of the puppers from this litter and decide for yourself ?",
